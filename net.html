<h2>The Art of Showing Your Throat</h2>
<br>
  <p>This project is a first-person interactive poetry book exploring themes of internal and external consciousness and the processes of loss and grief over time. This is a story "game" or experience is built within Twine and explores the intimate, text-forward, non-linear branching capabilities of the platform.<a href="https://huddlestun.github.io//Huddlestun_ART74_FinalProject.html">Click Here to Access</a>**Content Warning: Some content regards mortality and injury both visually and in literary form.

<p>HOW WAS IT MADE? A PEEK AT THE SKELETON OF THIS STORY: Below is the "map" created by my branching story structure. Each square is a tile, or page of the experience. They are structured in alternating image-text-image-text page patterns to develop context for the slides of denser narrative and make each page conceptually accessible. I first drew out a physical rough map in a notebook of boxes with potential names and linkage systems, then copied and iterated upon the original design within Twine.</p>

  <p>This is a linking webpage interactive poem aimed at taking the viewer through my personal experiences with retinal detachment and the progressive stages of blindness. It addresses the time before my diagnosis, my experience with surgery and recovery, and the ways in which the alteration of my physical perception impacted my intellectual and artistic perception.</p>
