    <p>For as long as I can recall the process of drawing, naming, and building mythologies has been embedded in the way that I operate- they are deeply rooted in the way that I function such that I view them as homeostatic in nature. The structures and systems that support the way that I operate are saturated with these internalized forms of practice. 
    Most commonly, my analog work is divided between multimedia drawings on paper and paintings on both traditional canvas support and canvas paper. My work in digital media typically focuses on net art sites, specifically net art poetry and story-based works, code projects in a variety of languages, and digital drawing/painting. All of my work remains informed and supported by their extensive conceptual architectures and stories in a generative dialogue of concept and structure.
    In any form, my work develops from a fascination with the natural sciences, the supernatural, and the evolution of my personal mythologies while ruminating on the functions of empathy, poetry, and grief. This vast array of references, spaces, and preoccupations forms the tenets of my practice which seeks to engage with art as a practice of myth and medicine.

<p>I am a multidisciplinary artist from San Jose, California pursuing a Pictorial Art BFA and Digital Media Art minor at San Jose State University. When I imagine my artistic beginnings, I see the kid that would sit hidden in a school garden-box, uniform disheveled and doodles in pen creeping up their hands and arms, with a clipboard chock-full of bent-edged papers and pen in hand. When asked what I wanted to do when I grew up I would say “the arts”. This language was important because in my mind “the arts” was all encompassing- variety in media, music, writing, and scientific fields. I now understand I was trying to describe a hyper-specific form of working- I was envisioning a practice.
  Graduating highschool and entering college at the cusp of a global pandemic, I was in many ways returned to my most formative ways of operating at the onset of massive growth in my practice. Nearing my last semester of college I have amassed a body of work expanding upon these roots, including large-scale and multi-panel pictorial works, a portfolio of digital media projects, and my first solo exhibition. Looking forward, I am developing a digital anthology and printing project as well as preparing for my BFA exhibition.
