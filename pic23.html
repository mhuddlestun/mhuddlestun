    <p>The Hiding Place is the result of my interest in further developing frames and structures that are both populated by and informed by the specific spaces and structures that I am developing and evolving in my practice. I spent time developing sketches and journaling about the function of spatial dynamics in the two dimensional plane, thinking about how to take the viewer from operating as an outsider looking in to being an outsider on the inside looking out. I wanted to experiment further with a method of image transfer I had learned in the class I made this piece for; a working mode that I found extremely rewarding for the way that it allowed me to accumulate and transform specific image records that correlate with the spaces and forms that exist in my practice conceptually and realize them in photographic detail. This allowed a great level of transformative potential, layered communication, and intimacy of space.</p>
