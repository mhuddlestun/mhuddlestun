  <h3>Interactive Game Coded with p5.js: The Sneaky Magpie</h3>
<br>
  <p>This is an interactive game coded in p5.js. The Sneaky Magpie is a single player game where the main goal is to steal progressively more valuable shiny objects until the player is sneaky enough to steal the **Shiniest Prize**. If they are able to do so, they will unlock the ultimate gift of ancient, shiny knowledge! To learn more about the magpie rhyme, here is my source: <a href="https://www.birdspot.co.uk/culture/one-for-sorrow-magpie-nursery-rhyme">Magpie Rhyme and Variations</a><br>All images I used were open source with no restriction, however I wanted to credit Dimitris Christou, who's image upload of a diamond to Pixabay (used in level 3) has proven useful in two of my projects now <hr> There is some really great magpie lore out there, especially in England, so if this interests you go on your own quest for shiny knowledge online or at your local library!</p>
