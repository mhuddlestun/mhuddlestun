  <h2>Healer:</h2>
  <img src="Image Assets/pictorial/Healer.JPG" class="mobile_responsive" alt="A variety of brightly colored organic shapes split diagonally between warm and cool colors. In the center is a light blue framed back rectangle with a veined orb inside." width="1336" height="1000.7">
  <p>Healer, 2020, Oil pastel on paper, 18 x 24 in</p>
  <p>Healer is an oil pastel work which uses layers of different colors in various geometric and organic shapes which are then scratched away to create colorful linear underlayers that establish form and complexity in detail. I made this piece as an abstract representation of my instincts to heal and protect, as well as a means of demonstrating the layered qualities of physical sight and perception. I was inspired by tantric paintings and the adjoining concept of intent as medium, as well as the ethos and stylistic approaches of Hilda af Klimt. I was influenced by a practice I developed as a child, where I used to place small glass beads from a box my grandmother has in her house at key points on the face as a means to heal. Most commonly one went over each eye, and I wanted to capture that feeling with a central sphere which is veined and varied in color and value to abstractly resemble light filtering through a closed eyelid surrounded by smaller elliptic shapes resembling lit glass beads.</p>

  <h2>Reluctance:</h2>
  <img src="Image Assets/pictorial/Reluctance_horizontal.JPG" class="mobile_responsive" alt="A skeleton and young figure interact with one another in a serious of tableaus." width="1464.5" height="2012.5">
  <p>Reluctance, 2020, Inks and and colored pen on paper, 18 x 24 in </p>
  <p>Reluctance is a piece contemplating the way that popular American culture approaches (or perhaps more appropriately lacks a sufficient approach to) death as a presence within and inevitability of life. Surrounding the creation of this piece I was thinking extensively about how one builds a relationship with mortality, as well as the concept of the reaper as a regretful and empathetic entity.</p>

  <h2>Nerve</h2>
  <img src="Image Assets/pictorial/Nerve_horizontal.JPG" class="mobile_responsive" alt="Diagrammatic profile view of a person drinking ivy from a cup. The ivy is shown growing within their anatomy and is framed by relevant detail views." width="1375" height="1881">
  <p>Nerve, 2020, Ink and colored pen on paper, 18 x 24 in </p>
  <p>Nerve is a piece using pen and ink as well as Micron liner pens to create a diagrammatic drawing, with additional color and lining added with a water soluble colored pen. This piece is the product of close observation of the functional and aesthetic qualities of ivy. My home has always had incredibly large patches of ivy, and I wanted to draw on the ways Iâ€™ve learned that ivy climbs and consumes its environment to create a piece that is a visual representation of the synergy between humans and nature/the plant world which we so often divorce ourselves from. Additional inspiration for this piece came from a short, guided plant meditation where I was able to consider in great detail the plant and each of its component as singular bodies, mentally tracing their forms and structures. During this time I found many analogs between the physicality of the plant and the human body, often conflating the two as I processed the qualites of the ivy I was meditating on.</p>

  <h2>Sever</h2>
  <img src="Image Assets/pictorial/Sever.JPG" class="mobile_responsive" alt="Apple tree growing from throat of humanoid character, each apple on the tree contains a different symbol. Axes frame the bottom of the image." width="1333" height="1004.7">
  <p>Sever, 2020, Inks on paper, 18 x 24 in </p>
  <p>Sever is an inkwork piece which incorporates both brushed ink drawing as well as fineline work with traditional pen/pen nibs. I made this work as an introspective snapshot of a dream which had made a vivid impression on me and persisted in my memory but had not been explored yet in an artwork. Both the dream it is based upon and this piece were created during times of struggle and sickness, and in many ways this work became a bridge through time and experience forged from this shared contextual catalyst.
