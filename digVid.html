  <p>Nocturnal Verse, 2022, 4 minutes and 36 seconds</p>
  <p>Nocturnal Verse I is the first in a planned mini-collection of videos approaching the mental accumulation of images, spaces, and phrases. This work is developed from a willingness to to allow these collections that build in one's psyche over time, festering and transforming, to take an external form. Formed largely from edited found footage and found sound, this piece seeks to find external analogs for these internal stores. The poem tracking this piece was written alongside its development.</p>
