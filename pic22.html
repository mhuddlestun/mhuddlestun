  <h1>Pictorial Works - 2022</h1>

  <h2>The Gate:</h2>
	   <img src="Image Assets/pictorial/TheGate_composite.JPG"  class="mobile_responsive" alt="A multi-panel composition of a beast creating an opening through which more beasts and symbols are present." width="1050" height="750">
  <p>The Gate, 2022, Oils on canvas paper, 108 in x 120 in, 12 in x 12 in per panel</p>
  <p>The Gate was a five-week project where I began to develop the structure of gates and portals as a means for allowing entrance points between the layered spaces being depicted and the viewer approaching them. I began the structure for this piece by laying down roughly forty one-foot square panels on the ground to see how to build out the shape. I then sketched a single, simple outline across the pages to get a sense of which panel was which part. I did not have enough space to work on them all at once, so each piece was painted separately over the span of its creation. I would then intermittently put together my finished pieces to see how they worked together. I was excited to see the stuttering and shifting between panels, creating a unified whole in a state of flux. I made the decision that the piece was about expressing something that opened the confines of a plane, and felt it was only appropriate that I cut the pieces out of the confines of their square grounds. I also created separate star forms that I used to populate the space between the openings in the final image. The arms and wrists at the top of the piece are connected by painted brads and can be folded and repositioned as necessary.</p>

<h2>City of Catacombs:</h2>
	   <img src="Image Assets/pictorial/CityofCatacombs_composite.JPG"  class="mobile_responsive" alt="A vertical diptych with a beast in oils on the top panel reaching down into a patchwork panel of equal size below." width="1050" height="750">
  <p>City of Catacombs, 2022, Oils on canvas (top) and gouache, watercolor, and sumi ink on paper (bottom), 25.5 in x 34 in per panel</p>
  <p>City of Catacombs is a diptych consisting of a stretched canvas ground (top) and a series of 30 individual panels (bottom) that were worked on individually and individually until the proper arrangement began to reveal itself. Once finished, all of the panels were joined into a single panel with backing paper and PVA glue. This piece was the product of a vivid dream where I was asked by some sort of pantheon of gods to create a massive mural on one of the walls of a palace, which was also a temple, a dungeon, and a place of burial. I painted a piece similar to the pictured image on the wall, where the being pictured above acted as a guardian and resident over this massive city of soil and brick. The best name I could come up with for this place was a city of catacombs or tombs, and I tried to develop different methods to explore this scene in my piece pictured above. I was thinking a lot about tar, oil, and states of decay when I worked on the top panel, something that translated into rendering of the beast, especially the reversed light and dark values in its shading.

  <h2>Beast of the Veil:</h2>
	   <img src="Image Assets/pictorial/BeastoftheVeil.JPG"  class="mobile_responsive" alt="A diptych with a  beast pressing through the panel on the left and an abstract work in greens and browns with scretchmarks in the paint on the right." width="945.75" height="604.5">
  <p>Beast of the Veil, 2022, Oils on canvas (left) and acrylic on paper (right), 18 in x 24 in per panel</p>
  <p>Beast of the Veil was the product of a prompt to make a diptych consisting of a ‘good’ and ‘bad’ painting,  raising a variety of questions about how either of these designations may be qualified and represented. For my ‘good’ painting I delved into the things that I enjoy about painting, the palette, the ability to experiment with representation, suggestion, and illusion, and the effectiveness in giving believable form to imagined scenes. In the right hand image I tried to work with cheap acrylics in sporadic, timed periods with a taped off edge; all things that I largely avoid when I am working. Despite this, when the two were placed together they began to suggest interesting forms of narrative and affect between the two planes.  </p>

	<h2>Different Skies:</h2>
	   <img src="Image Assets/pictorial/DifferentSkies.jpg" class="mobile_responsive" alt="A painting of sharp-edged abstract shapes in reds, blues, purples, and blacks on an off-white background." width="576.25" height="1609.5">
  <p>Different Skies, 2022, Oils on canvas, 18 in x 24 in </p>
  <p>Different Skies is a work that I created playing with shapes and symbols to create a composition which fluctuates between organisms, places, symbols, and some form of alien alphabet. During the making of this piece, as often occurs with shapes such as these, the gesture and physical execuation of the edges and facets of each shape became a form of private performance and informed the growth of each shape.</p>

  <h2>Suspension:</h2>
	   <img src="Image Assets/pictorial/Suspension.JPG" class="mobile_responsive" alt="A polyptich (one large piece with two thin pieces on either side of it) showing a central rift exposing a variety of symbols in red. At the top of the rift is a beast's head spread in two. The side panels have detail views related to Metamorphosis and Vitreous Kingdom.">
  <p>Suspension, 2022, External panels: sumi ink, gouache, watercolor, and colored pencil on paper 12 in x 72 in (x4) ; Central panel: sumi ink, alcohol marker, and colored pencil on paper, 60 in x  in </p>
  <p>Suspension was born from the two concepts I identified as central to the idea of artist inquisition as a practice of medicine during the development of Malady- recursion and suspension. I envisioned an infinite number of layers which exist within and without all things as we understand them. To practice this kind of ‘medicine’ which seeks to dissect, diagnose, heal, preserve, and mourn all at once these layers may be pulled into a state of suspension and isolated, recombined, or met with intervention to be fluidly interacted with. To identify the openings into the planes I consider the function of recursion, a form of affirmative study where the isolated entry-points are made up of images, concepts, and processes that have a particular quality that attracts me. In this way, I sense invisible patterns and connections that breed dynamic possibilities. In Suspension I began to visualize these ideas through a massive catalog of symbol-organisms and layers that both frame and populate themselves.  </p>

<h2>Metamorphic:</h2>
	   <img src="Image Assets/pictorial/Metamorphic.jpg" class="mobile_responsive" alt="A fossil-like, skeletal form with features reminiscent of a bat flanked by interlocking forms and symbols." width="600.25" height="883.25">
	   .">
  <p>Metamorphic, 2022, Alcohol marker, sumi ink, and gouache, 48 in x 72 in </p>
  <p> Metamorphic is a piece developed for my first solo exhibition, Malady. This piece was developed from a fascination with the magics and structures that I began developing a language for in Empathic Web. This piece came from an interest in solid substances and forms, building a piece and visual fingerprint influenced by bony structures, fossilization, calcification, and similar ancient processes. There were a myriad of elements other than those listed above, and I took each of these to develop forms of working and symbols that would express and interact with these kinds of forces, manifested as maladies which construct the central figure.</p>

<h2>Vitreous Kingdom:</h2>
	   <img src="Image Assets/pictorial/VitreousKingdom.jpg" class="mobile_responsive" alt="A fluid composition of overlapping symbols, forms, and creatures of varying opacity." width="580" height="819.5">
  <p>Vitreous Kingdom, 2022, Sumi ink, gouache, oil pastel, and colored pencil on paper, 48 in x 72 in </p>
  <p> Vitreous Kingdom is a piece that was developed for the Malady exhibition. In direct opposition to Metamorphic this piece is concerned with liquid and intangible substances and magics, considering visual phenomena, fluids like blood and sap, apparitions, and glass. In a similar process to Metamorphic an extensive accumulation of references and anchoring points led to the development of particular marks, forms, and compositional structures. This piece was a turning point in how I was able to interact with and realize the work that was rapidly evolving in my practice through spaces and frameworks.</p>

<h2>Text Paintings:</h2>
	   <img src="Image Assets/pictorial/TextPaintings_horizontal.JPG" class="mobile_responsive" alt="A painting in dark jewel tones with a dark purple glaze, comprised of decorative text, poetry, and the image of a glass (left) and A painting in pastel colors comprised of decorative text and poetry (right)." width="1391.5.5" height="1762.5">
  <p>(left)The Nocturne's Goblet, 2022, Oils on canvas, 18 in x 24 in ; (right)The Quiet Glade, 2022, Oils on canvas, 18 in x 24 in  </p>
  <p> These pieces are each formed from the text of two poems, written specially for each of the pieces in the moment as they were being painted. These poems come from two core memories and the complex systems that they suggest. Rooted in spaces that form two poles of space and story, they present a singular, high contrast body informed by two contrasting halves.</p>

<h2>Empathic Web</h2>
  <img src="Image Assets/pictorial/EmpathicWeb_horizontal.JPG" class="mobile_responsive" alt="A large, multi-panel piece tracking interconnected symbolic webs in a singular macro view." >
  <p>Empathic Web, 2022, Alcohol marker, sumi ink, and graphite on paper, 110 in x 108 in (11 in x 14 in and 18 in x 24 in panels)</p>   
  <img src="Image Assets/pictorial/EmpathicWeb_Details.jpg" class="mobile_responsive" alt="A large, multi-panel piece tracking interconnected symbolic webs in a singular macro view." width="1471.5" height="1955.5">
  <p>Empathic Web, 2022, Composite of detail images</p>   
  <p>Empathic Web was a months-long project committed to tracking, developing, and structuring a piece that spoke to the function of my work in part as a practice of medicine. I was guided by the function of healing and medicine as a conceptual and visual magic, and more specifically the function of persistence in attempting to heal the unhealable as a pure form of empathy. I was fascinated in the functions of supernaturality and driven by a developing relationship with grief, sickness, and fear. I created different forms of symbolic and visual languages that developed in the form of symbol-organisms and beast forms while suggesting spaces, languages, and sciences developing in real-time.
