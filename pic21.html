  <h1>Pictorial Works - 2021</h1>

<h2>Fortify</h2>
  <img src="Image Assets/pictorial/Fortify_horizontal.JPG" class="mobile_responsive" alt="A graphite drawing of a gargoyle on a gothic stone facade." width="1471.5" height="1955.5">
  <p>Fortify, 2021, Graphite on paper, 7 in x 11 in </p> 
  <p>Fortify was largely a technical exercise, seeking to push my abilities to render dimension and form with graphite pencil. The image of the gargoyle is one which I’ve found interesting to consider in function, concept, and visual quality; however this is the only time I’ve actually explicitly drawn one. At the time I was taking a course where we had learned about traditional techniques and were encouraged to use these methods to create something that could not possibly exist in our world while including objects that are realistic studies. I used this as the jumping-off point for this piece, imaging architecture that was a composite of real references that had never truly existed and questions around the sentience and presence of the gargoyle itself. The basin and the stick in the gargoyle’s hand are a mortar and pestle that I had previously done a study of.</p>

<h2>Recede</h2>
  <img src="Image Assets/pictorial/Recede_horizontal.JPG" class="mobile_responsive" alt="A skeletal figure is shown with its head encircled by a crown of eyes woven by their optic nerves. The background is populated by sketchy shapes divided by a single scratchy line." width="1375" height="1823.5">
  <p>Recede, 2021, Ink, marker, and gouache on paper, 18 x 24 in </p>   
  <p>Recede was made at a time when I was creating a large body of different works following my inability to draw or do any upclose work for about a month. I wanted to create something incredibly intricate and detailed as a challenge to myself after such a long hiatus, as well as a way to dive back into the small details I have always enjoyed. As will be true for a few other works in this portfolio made around the same timeframe, I was drawing from a very isolated pool of internal images, scenes, and gestures that I’d been seeing in my head before I was able to get back into art. I experienced the onset of vision loss from an undiagnosed retinal detachment and break for a few months before recieving reattachment surgery. As such this piece visually expresses the visual disturbances I now live alongside, as well as visually expressing the ways that vision loss causes one to have a much more direct internal consciousness.</p>

	<h2>Eight of Swords:</h2>
  <img src="Image Assets/pictorial/EightofSwords_horizontal.JPG" class="mobile_responsive" alt="Black and white image displaying an armored figure with eight arms drawing eight swords from its eyes. A green border surrounds the figure with a black border around this." width="1148.5" height="1387.5">
  <p>Eight of Swords, 2021, Inks and gouache on paper, 14 x 17 in </p>
  <p> Eight of Swords is one piece of the set of pieces I made after living with a severe retinal detachment, recieving scleral buckle surgery, and was made not only as a challenge to myself to keep working once I was able to retrain my skills, but as a documentation of a specific point in that period of my life. As will be true for my pieces from this timeframe, I am mainly drawing from my isolated consciousness and the images I had in my head while I was unable to work. Specifically, this piece is a document of a dream I had the night before my surgery. When I started drawing this image, the eight swords being drawn from the blind eyes of the wielder came naturally, and later I looked up the symbolic value of the image elements to find they almost exactly match the eight of swords tarot card both in imagery and meaning. </p>

   <h2>Visions</h2>
  <img src="Image Assets/pictorial/Visions.JPEG" class="mobile_responsive" alt="Two bird-like creatures fight over a disembodied eye. The piece is rendered in black and white with red embelishment." width="970.3" height="796.3">
  <p>Visions, 2021, Ink and gouache on paper, 14 x 17 in</p>
  <p>Visions is the first piece I made once I was cleared to do work up close after my scleral buckle surgery, and the imagery and detail both were a major mental release of imagery I could finally get out through drawing after a long period of rest and proof to me that I was still capable of the level of work and detail that I had been losing the capability to do before my surgery. It was purely an extraction of imagery I had in my head waiting for when I could start working again in terms of influence. I wanted to capture the sense of struggle, distortion, conflict, and enhanced inner consciousness that I was experiencing, as well as express the amount of pent-up creative energy I had by working in extreme detail.</p>

  <h2>Digestion:</h2>
  <img src="Image Assets/pictorial/Digestion.JPG" class="mobile_responsive" alt="Three pieces each composed of layered symbols including wolves, eyes, moons, faces." width="4800" height="1800">
  <p>Digestion, 2021, Alcohol marker, gouache, ink, and oil pastel on paper, 18 x 24 in each</p>
  <p>Digestion is a multimedia work which applies layering and non-linear composition to visually communicate its conceptual basis. Though the application varies between panels and some stop earlier in the process or develop further, the general appraoch is as follows: a base layer of marker outlines the entire composition, peeking through a secondary layer of sumi ink linework done with a thin brush, a third layer of colored gouache detailed lining, and finally a charcoal backdrop layered on top. I made this piece as an exploration of the constant information intake and overwhelming consumptive media practices I found a need to balance as the pandemic began. During the making of this piece I was relying on latent images that had been cycling in my head and putting them together in an implied emotional space. This piece was heavily influenced by my need to confront my reliance on distraction and the constant overwhelming streams of information I was exposing myself to as a means of avoiding complex and difficult situations at the onset of the pandemic.</p>
